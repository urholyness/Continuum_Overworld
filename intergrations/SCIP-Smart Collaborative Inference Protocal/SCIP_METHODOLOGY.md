# SCIP - Smart Collaborative Inference Protocol

## Updated Methodology (2025-08-06)

After Grok's analysis of recurring debugging cycles, SCIP has been enhanced with anti-cycle protocols.

## Core SCIP Process

### S - **STOP & Analyze**
**NEW**: Before any System design, perform **Dependency Chain Analysis**
- Map all components that could be affected
- Identify root causes vs symptoms
- Document the exact problem statement
- **MANDATORY**: Use `/Projects/DEBUGGING_GUARDRAILS.md` methodology

### C - **Collaborative Planning** 
- Break down complex problems into isolated layers
- Plan verification steps for each component
- **NEW**: Single-issue resolution protocol - fix one thing completely before moving to next
- Predict cascade effects of proposed changes

### I - **Intelligent Implementation**
- **NEW**: Minimum viable change principle - smallest fix that addresses root cause
- Layer-by-layer implementation with verification checkpoints
- No new scripts/tools until fundamentals are fixed
- Test each change in isolation before proceeding

### P - **Progressive Verification**
- **NEW**: Real-process verification - test actual execution, not simulated
- Document what was changed and why
- Verify no new problems introduced
- Full integration testing only after all components verified individually

## Anti-Cycle Protocols

### Before Starting Any SCIP Process:
1. **Check for warning signs** of destructive cycles:
   - Multiple error types appearing simultaneously
   - Previous "fixes" creating new problems
   - Error messages changing but not disappearing
   - Persistent transaction/state failures

2. **If cycle detected**: EMERGENCY STOP
   - Reset to last known working state
   - Apply `/Projects/DEBUGGING_GUARDRAILS.md` methodology
   - Do NOT proceed with SCIP until cycle is broken

### Enhanced SCIP Steps:

#### S - STOP & Analyze (Enhanced)
- **Mandatory Questions**:
  1. What exactly is the root cause? (Not just error message)
  2. What dependency chain is involved?
  3. What has been tried before and why did it fail?
  4. What could this change affect downstream?

#### C - Collaborative Planning (Enhanced)  
- **Verification-First Planning**:
  - Plan how to test each component in isolation
  - Define success criteria for each step
  - Identify rollback procedures if things go wrong
  - **NEVER plan multiple simultaneous changes**

#### I - Intelligent Implementation (Enhanced)
- **Layer Isolation Protocol**:
  1. Environment layer (dependencies, setup)
  2. Model layer (data structures, schemas)  
  3. Database layer (schema, connections)
  4. API layer (routes, endpoints)
  5. Integration layer (full system)
- **One layer at a time, fully verified before next**

#### P - Progressive Verification (Enhanced)
- **Mandatory Verification Steps**:
  - Test individual component works in isolation
  - Verify no regression in previously working components
  - Check all predicted cascade effects
  - Document actual vs expected behavior
  - **Only proceed if 100% success on current layer**

## Integration with Other Frameworks

### MAR Integration
- MAR's "single-issue resolution" aligns with SCIP's enhanced verification
- Use MAR's cascade impact assessment in SCIP's planning phase

### MCP Integration  
- MCP's diagnostic verification requirements complement SCIP's stop phase
- Apply MCP's manual command testing within SCIP's implementation phase

## Success Metrics

A successful SCIP process should result in:
- ✅ Root cause completely resolved (not just symptom)
- ✅ No new problems introduced
- ✅ Each layer verified independently
- ✅ Full system working after integration
- ✅ Clear documentation of changes made

## Failure Recovery

If SCIP process fails:
1. **STOP immediately** - do not try quick fixes
2. **Reset** to last known working state
3. **Re-analyze** with deeper dependency mapping
4. **Apply emergency protocols** from debugging guardrails
5. **Restart SCIP** only after environment is clean

**Remember**: The goal is permanent solutions, not quick patches that create more problems.
