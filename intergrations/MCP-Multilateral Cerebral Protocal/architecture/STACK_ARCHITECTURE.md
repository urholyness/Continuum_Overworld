# MCP (Multilateral Cerebral Protocol) Stack Architecture Documentation

## Overview
The Multilateral Cerebral Protocol (MCP) is a cognitive framework designed to prevent destructive debugging cycles and ensure systematic problem resolution through rigorous verification and multilateral thinking. The system provides a structured approach to cognitive processing with enhanced diagnostic protocols and anti-cycle mechanisms.

**Core Mission**: Create certainty through rigorous verification, not uncertainty through hasty solutions.

## System Architecture

### Core Philosophy
- **Multilateral Thinking**: Multiple cognitive pathways must converge on the same diagnosis
- **Diagnostic Verification**: All solutions must be manually verifiable before automation
- **Layer Isolation**: Execute changes in isolated layers with full verification between each
- **Single-Change Execution**: One change at a time with complete verification
- **State Consistency**: Maintain system state consistency throughout all operations

### Updated Protocol (2025-08-06)
Enhanced after Grok's analysis revealed destructive cycles where diagnostic shortcuts led to cascading problems instead of solutions.

## Core MCP Process Architecture

### M - Multilateral Thinking (Enhanced)
**NEW**: **Diagnostic Verification Requirement** - All cognitive pathways must converge on the same root cause diagnosis

#### Mandatory Components
1. **Convergent Diagnosis Protocol**: All thinking angles must agree on the problem
2. **Cross-verification**: Multiple perspectives validate the same root cause
3. **Systematic Analysis**: Use systematic root-cause analysis, not symptom-based thinking
4. **Dependency Chain Reasoning**: Apply dependency chain analysis from debugging guardrails

#### Divergence Resolution
- If thinking pathways disagree, STOP and investigate deeper
- No proceeding until diagnostic consensus achieved
- Document reasoning for chosen diagnostic path
- **No "best guess" solutions allowed**

### C - Cerebral Processing (Enhanced)
**NEW**: **Manual Command Testing Protocol** - All solutions must be testable through manual verification

#### Processing Requirements
1. **Manual Verification**: Every proposed solution must be manually testable
2. **Step-by-step Verification**: Break complex solutions into manually verifiable steps
3. **Real-Process Testing**: Test actual systems, not simulated environments
4. **Success Criteria**: Each step must have clear success/failure criteria

#### Critical Rules
- **No automation/scripting until manual process proven**
- **Use real commands, real files, real database operations**
- **Verify each step before proceeding to next**
- **Document exact manual commands that work**

### P - Protocol Execution (Enhanced)
**NEW**: **Layer Isolation Verification** - Execute changes in isolated layers with full verification between each

#### Execution Protocol
1. **Single-Change Execution**: Change ONE thing (minimum viable change)
2. **Isolation Testing**: Test that one change in isolation
3. **Side Effect Verification**: Verify no side effects introduced
4. **Documentation**: Document what changed and why
5. **Progressive Execution**: Only then proceed to next change

#### State Consistency Verification
- Checkpoint system state before each change
- Verify state consistency after each change
- **Rollback immediately** if state becomes inconsistent
- No proceeding until state is verified clean

## Anti-Cycle Protocols

### Cognitive Cycle Detection
Before Protocol Initiation:
1. **Are we solving the same problem repeatedly?**
2. **Have previous solutions created new problems?**
3. **Is the problem definition shifting without resolution?**
4. **Are we generating scripts instead of fixing fundamentals?**

### Emergency Procedures
If Cycle Detected:
1. **STOP all protocol execution**
2. **Reset to last verified working state**
3. **Apply single-threaded diagnostic approach**
4. **Only resume MCP after clean cognitive state confirmed**

        self.project_memory_paths = {}
    
    def load_memory(self, project_name):

## Cognitive Anti-Patterns Prevention

### The "Quick Fix" Anti-Pattern
- **Symptom**: Generating solutions before full diagnosis
- **Prevention**: Mandatory diagnostic verification phase
- **Recovery**: Stop, reset, re-diagnose with full methodology

### The "Multi-Change" Anti-Pattern
- **Symptom**: Changing multiple components simultaneously
- **Prevention**: Single-change execution protocol
- **Recovery**: Rollback to last verified state, apply changes one-by-one

### The "Script-First" Anti-Pattern
- **Symptom**: Creating automation before manual process works
- **Prevention**: Manual verification requirements
- **Recovery**: Abandon scripts, prove manual process first

### The "Cascade Ignoring" Anti-Pattern
- **Symptom**: Not considering downstream effects of changes
- **Prevention**: Dependency chain analysis in thinking phase
- **Recovery**: Map all affected components, verify each individually
