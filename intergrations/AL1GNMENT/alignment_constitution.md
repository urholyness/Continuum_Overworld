# ⚖️ AL1GNMENT Constitution (First Draft)

## **Preamble**
We, the participants of the AL1GNMENT network, establish this Constitution to safeguard truth, equality, and decentralized ownership. AL1GNMENT exists not as a product to be sold, but as a collective utility built on shared values. Its worth is derived from the *honest insights* of individuals. In anonymity, we speak truth. In truth, we build value. In value, we find freedom.

## **Article I: Purpose and Mission**
AL1GNMENT is a global, non-acquirable, decentralized platform for equitable digital ownership, social good, and truth-seeking through pseudonymous, voluntary participation. It is designed to resist centralization and commodification.

## **Article II: Equal and Automatic Ownership**
- Each verified user receives one non-transferable soulbound token representing equal ownership.
- Ownership is not influenced by race, gender, location, contribution, or time of joining.

## **Article VII: Privacy and Anonymity by Design**
- AL1GNMENT collects no names, IDs, or biometric identifiers.
- All insights, votes, and contributions are pseudonymous and may use zero-knowledge proofs to ensure privacy.

## **Article VIII: Anti-Corruption and Whistleblower Support**
- Users may anonymously report systemic abuse, bribery, or inefficiencies through in-app feedback or micro-surveys.

## **Article IX: Regional Sovereignty with Global Integrity**
- Sub-treasuries and regional DAOs may operate independently but must adhere to constitutional principles.
- Local laws may be observed unless they infringe on user equality, transparency, or decentralization.

---

## **Article X: Non-Commercialization Clause**
- AL1GNMENT shall never be sold, privatized, merged, or acquired.
- Its code and governance structures are open-source, public, and unchangeable without community supermajority.

---

## **Article XI: On the Value of Truth**
- The value of AL1GNMENT lies in its ability to gather honest insights from individuals, free of coercion or bias.
- These truths, spoken anonymously, form the lifeblood of the platform.
- Honesty is the core currency. Truth is our shared foundation.
