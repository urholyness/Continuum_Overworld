        information given by the ``IResourceProvider``.  You may set this to a
        temporary directory, but then you must call ``cleanup_resources()`` to
        delete the extracted files when done.  There is no guarantee that
        ``cleanup_resources()`` will be able to remove all extracted files.

        manager once resources have been extracted, unless you first call
        ``cleanup_resources()``.)
